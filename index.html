    <p id="generalText">Hello! I am <b>David Perez</b>. <br />I'm an aspiring, enthusiastic game developer and 
    <b>programmer!</b> I like to examine the games that I play to discern the intent behind their designs
    and use that introspection in my own works. I also like to dabble a bit in audio and writing to spruce up
    presentation and narrative beats.<br /> <br />
    As you might expect, I play a lot of video games. I enjoy analytical content such as podcasts and reviews, often while I'm
    playing games. I also have an interest in cooking quality food and occasionally experiment with new recipes. <br /> <br />
    I have skills in C# and C++ programming having written scripts in Unity and Unreal Engine. I'm also capable of 
    creating webpages (such as this one!), editing images and videos and I'm capable with audio engineering as well.
