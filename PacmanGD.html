    <p id="generalText"> Pacman in Godot is a project I created to better understand the Godot engine. Prior to the project, I had 
        no experience with the engine. The assets and directions for constructing this project are from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CncJvOEM3OA&t">CyberPotato on Youtube</a>,
        codebase on <a href="https://github.com/wojciech-bilicki/Pacman_Tutorial">Github here</a> under the name Wojciech Bilicki.
        <br> <br>
        I worked in Version 4.2.1 and had to make changes from the guide in order match the output shown. One such difference is the pathing for the ghosts
        which doesn't use a resource file as was shown. Another difference was the inclusion of a title screen, which while using the font asset from the guide,
        a title screen was not created in the demonstration and is my addition. My recreation of the game is not totally accurate with a few features such as fruits
        missing and a bug wherein Pacman may attempt to turn when he can't resulting in getting stuck on corners. <br> <br>
        Try the game: <br>
        <a href="dwl/PacmanGD_Linux.tar.gz" download="">PacmanGD for Linux</a>
        <br>
        <a href="dwl/PacmanGD_Windows.7z" download="">PacmanGD for Windows</a>

    <p id="generalText"> The game features lives and points tracking, different states for the ghosts and a proper reseting of the 
        game on death that either starts the player and ghosts in the same board if the player has lives or game over if the player 
        is out of lives.  <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>

    <p id="generalText">
        Collecting a power pellet empowers Pacman to be able to eat ghosts while they run. Ghosts that are inside the center box
        are unaffected by the collection of power pellets as well as ghosts that are already eaten. 
        (and I've included a secret if all 4 power pellets are eaten during the fleeing state for the ghosts!) <br> <br> <br>
