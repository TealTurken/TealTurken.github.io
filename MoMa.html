        Momo and Mako is a platformer designed to visually emulate the early 3D platformers of the
        Nintendo 64 and Playstation 1 era. <br /> <br />
        The game is built in Unreal Engine 5. The main feature is the use of two characters at once, big sister Momo and little brother Mako, combining
        their skills and working together to overcome obstacles.<br /> <br /> 
        The project consisted of 13 members of Violet Peak Studios.<br /> I contributed primarily as a programmer creating scripts for movement,
        objects and behaviors. I built the ability for the characters to throw the other to aid in reaching high and distant spots
        as well as a piggyback mechanic so the two may travel faster. I also implemented a checkpoint and level transition system 
        and created a dynamic, configurable moving platform system.
