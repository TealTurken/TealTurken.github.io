        Momo and Mako is a platformer designed to visually emulate the early 3D platformers of the
        Nintendo 64 and Playstation 1 era.
        <br /> <br />
        The project consisted of 13 members of Violet Peak Studios. The game is built in Unreal Engine 5 and the main feature is the use of two characters
        at once, big sister Momo and little brother Mako, combining their skills and working together to overcome obstacles. I contributed primarily as a 
        programmer creating scripts for movement, objects and behaviors.
        <br /> <br />
        I wanted the movement to feel responsive and the feedback to be clear, so I examined platformers and
        did my best to emulate their features. I built a drop shadow as well as tuned up air control to aid in jump accuracy and fine tuned run
        accelleration for when small positional adjustments would be helpful such as near ledges. Because the game features two protogonists,
        I built the ability for the characters to throw and be able to climb to the other to aid in reaching high and distant spots as well as
        a piggyback mechanic which increases run speed.
        <br /> <br />
        I also implemented checkpoints, a level transition system and created a dynamic, configurable moving platform system. I further updated the moving
        platforms to allow for hazardous obstacles which can be any game object that level designers assign it to be.
