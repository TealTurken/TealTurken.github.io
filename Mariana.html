    <p id="generalText"> Mariana is a 2D horror game built in Unity. A scientist in a facility on the ocean floor finds themselves
    the last survivor from an attack from an unknown creature. Help is on the way, but the hunt is on. <br /> <br />
    The objective is to survive until rescue arrives. Various things can go wrong, such as the lights going out, which can put the scientist
    at a disadvantage until they're rebooted.

    <p id="generalText"> I was one of the programmers on the project. My work was focused primarily on the characters, the scientist and 
    the creature. I handled the capabilities of the scientist; general movement, sprinting and aiming via wherever the mouse is pointed to on screen.
    <br /> <br /> I also scripted the creature, defining it's behaviors and implemented the navigation system so it could pathfind throughout the level.
